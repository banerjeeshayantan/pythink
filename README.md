This is a repo containing python projects.
Some progrmas from the book:
1.Write function longest_seq which takes an input string S and a character C
and returns the length of the longest sequence of Cs in S.
(Example: longest_seq(’abbacccd’,’b’) should return 2.)
2.The Catalan numbers Cn are a sequence of integers (1; 1; 2; 5; 14; 42; : : : )
that play an important role in quantum mechanics and the theory of
disordered systems. They are de?ned by
C0 = 1; Cn+1 =
4n + 2
n + 2
Cn:
Write a program that prints in increasing order all Cn  106
